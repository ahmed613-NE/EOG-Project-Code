# Project Third Eye
Project Third Eye Roadmap

Uses EOG signals from one or two eyes to control a camera mounted on servo motors with two degrees of freedom
, allowing the camera to precisely track the eye's angle of gaze in four directions without head movement.

Experiment

Exploring EOG signal correlation with horizontal eye movement rotation angle

Protocol

Material:
PERSONAL PC
BACKYARD BRAIN (BYB) HEART & BRAIN SPIKERBOX
SPIKE RECORDER
Manual Perimetry
9 V battery 
Red zip tie

Procedure：

Spikerbox Set up	

Connect the 9V battery to the BYB.
Open BYB switch and see a green LED.
Connect it to the PC.
Open your PC.
Download Spike Recorder if needed. https://backyardbrains.com/products/spikerecorder
Open Spike Recorder and establish connection to the BOX. (Be sure the battery is connected and the microphone is muted)

Electrode Set up 

Pull out the orange headband in the BYB set and apply gel to the spherical side (refer to https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/EOG, flip the spherical side out to apply and then put onto your head so the gel won’t go into your head)
Clip the black wire out of the orange cable with the pad (use a new one if necessary), and attach it onto the bony protrusion behind your ear
Clip the red wires onto the two head band buttons, sequence should not matter.
Connect the cable to the BYB box.

Pretrial Spike Recorder Setup

Digital Filter Selection (10-22 Hz worked for me, try out your own selection of filter frequency) based on your eye movement, ideally little or no noise, the cleaner the better. 

Recording

Purpose: Use the red zip tie to guide the looking direction and measure the peak of EOG recorded using BYB. Later to do polynomial fit to the scatter plot.

Have the participant sit down and adjust the perimetry to parallel view.
Use the red zip tie to point to the viewing point.
The duration of the whole experiment should be 90 s.
The angle difference between each eye movement should be larger than 30 degrees.
Should be 18 Eye movement points recorded every trial.
The pointed angle should be video recorded for later alignment
Labels should be added when the eye looks at the zip tie pointer. Temporary using 1 for looking at the center point and 2 for looking left, 3 for looking right. 
Always look back into the center.
Ideally 4 person collecting data ( 1 pointing, 1 looking, 1 recording the video and 1 labeling the looking direction)
If only 2 people, use a tripod to record. Do not let the subject to label as it will introduce movement artifacts.
Procedure
Start Phone recording.
Start BYB recording.
Point randomly, till point 1 2 3 … 18. Label 1 when looking left and label 2 when looking right. ( relative to the subject)
End BYB recording.
End Phone recording.
Output Label.
Output Phone recording.
Output BYB recording.
